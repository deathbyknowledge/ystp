# YSTP
YSTP (short for Your Super Transfer Program) is a file transfer tool that allows sending a file privately to a party directly without relying on port-forwarding to be set up.

It’s quick and easy to use and it all lives on Cloudflare’s edge, built with Workers and Durable Objects. No storage anywhere, just a transfer.

It's just an educational project, although it does work ofc! You can read the blog posts [here](https://deathbyknowledge.com/posts/ystp-pt1/).
